## üìãOverview
- Analysis of an scRNA-seq dataset of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate (non-Ca) samples using the **Seurat** package, with subsequent modeling via generalized additive models (GAMs) through the **mgcv** package. 

- The GAM fitting is implemented with thin-plate regression splines (TPRS), regularized by penalized residual sum of squares (PRSS) based on the smoothing parameter $\lambda$ derived from restricted maximum likelihood (REML).

- Introducing the **CEP-IP framework** **[cell explanatory power (CEP) with inflection point (IP)]** that subsets the cell subpopulations into quadrants, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis uncovers distinct biological pathways for each cell subpopulation. 

- **The methodology is generalizable** - **[Fork this repository](https://github.com/kahkengwong/CEP-IP_Framework/fork)** and adapt this framework for your own gene pairs and cell types.

## üéØAims of the Project
The following are the project's objectives:
1) To optimize and explain the modeling with mgcv package including *k*, $\lambda$, and $\gamma$ optimization process, PRSS and REML convergence, and visualization of splines' formation.
2) To determine how much does _TRPM4_ explain variability in Ribo (average expression of seven ribosomal genes) expression via deviance explained, GAM's performance metrics. 
3) To identify which cells hold strong _TRPM4_-Ribo relationship via the CEP-IP framework, and to uncover their potentially distinctive biology.

This processed dataset is based on publicly available data from:

## üîÄWorkflow of the Project
![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kahkengwong/CEP-IP_Framework/main/Project_Workflow.jpg)

- Key methodologies of this study include identification of cells most well-predicted by the model: If a cell is well-predicted, it should have high **explanatory power (EP)**. These cells are termed as **top-ranked EP (TREP) cells**. These crucial steps are detailed in part (V) of the figure above.

- Another key method is to binarize the transcriptional space by **inflection point (IP)** into **pre-IP and post-IP regions**. These regions exhibit distinct distribution pattern of TREP cells, producing **quadrants of four subpopulation of cells with different biology**.

- Collectively, this forms the **CEP-IP framework** detailed in the next section.

## üíª Requirements
### Software Requirements
- **R:** ‚â• 4.0.0 (tested with R 4.4.2 "Pile of Leaves")
- **RStudio:** Recommended (tested with RStudio 2025.05.0 Build 496)

### Hardware Requirements
- **RAM:** 16GB (32GB recommended)

- **Storage:** ~12GB free disk space for data and results

### Development Environment
- **Developed and tested on:** Intel Core i9-14900KF, 64GB DDR5 RAM, RTX 4090, Windows 11 Pro, RStudio 2025.05.0 Build 496, R 4.4.2

### Performance Notes
- All analyses are CPU-based; GPU acceleration not required
- Higher specs are primarily for scRNA-seq preprocessing (e.g., doublet removal, Kendall's œÑ computation)
- GAM modeling with [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html) is computationally efficient and does not require high-end specs
- Understanding the algorithms and mathematical principles is key; minimum specs are sufficient for GAM analysis using the processed Seurat object
> [!NOTE]
> üí°**To students and young researchers:** Limited computational resources should never prevent one from learning the key methodologies and mathematical principles in machine learning; understanding them matters more than hardware specs.
