## üìãOverview
Analysis of an scRNA-seq dataset of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate (non-Ca) samples using the **Seurat** package, with subsequent modeling via generalized additive models (GAMs) through the **mgcv** package. The GAM is implemented with thin-plate regression splines (TPRS), regularized by penalized residual sum of squares (PRSS) based on the smoothing parameter $\lambda$ derived from restricted maximum likelihood (REML). 

## üéØAims of the Project
The following are the project's objectives:
1) To optimize and interpret the modeling with mgcv package including *k*, $\lambda$, and $\gamma$ optimization process, PRSS and REML convergence, and visualization of splines' formation.
2) To uncover how much does _TRPM4_ explain variability in Ribo (average expression of seven ribosomal genes) expression via deviance explained, GAM's performance metrics. 
3) To identify which cells hold strong _TRPM4_-Ribo relationship, and to uncover their biology via Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. 

This processed dataset is based on publicly available data from: 
Wong HY, Sheng Q, Hesterberg AB, Croessmann S et al. Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease. Nat Commun 2022;13(1):6036. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33780-1

## üìäscRNA-seq Analysis and GAM-PRSS-REML Modeling Scripts
The processed Seurat object `GSE185344_Seurat_processed.RData` (9.52 GB) is available on HuggingFace: 
https://huggingface.co/datasets/kahkengwong/GAM_PCa_Project

The results of the GAM modeling in this study can be replicated by analyzing the processed Seurat object `GSE185344_Seurat_processed.RData` by following the code block `Part_3.01_Mean_Expression_Justifications.r` until `Part_3.15_Monocle3_Pre-IP_vs_Post-IP_TREP.r`

For the complete workflow, the scripts should be used in the following sequence, corresponding to the flow of the main project/manuscript:
