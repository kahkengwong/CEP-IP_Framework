## üìãOverview
Analysis of an scRNA-seq dataset of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate (non-Ca) samples using the **Seurat** package, with subsequent modeling via generalized additive models (GAMs) through the **mgcv** package. The GAM is implemented with thin-plate regression splines (TPRS), regularized by penalized residual sum of squares (PRSS) based on the smoothing parameter $\lambda$ derived from restricted maximum likelihood (REML). 

## üéØAims of the Project
The following are the project's objectives:
1) To optimize and interpret the modeling with mgcv package including *k*, $\lambda$, and $\gamma$ optimization process, PRSS and REML convergence, and visualization of splines' formation.
2) To uncover how much does _TRPM4_ explain variability in Ribo (average expression of seven ribosomal genes) expression via deviance explained, GAM's performance metrics. 
3) To identify which cells hold strong _TRPM4_-Ribo relationship, and to uncover their biology via Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. 

This processed dataset is based on publicly available data from: 
Wong HY, Sheng Q, Hesterberg AB, Croessmann S et al. Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease. Nat Commun 2022;13(1):6036. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33780-1

## üíª Requirements
### Software Requirements
- **R:** ‚â• 4.0.0 (tested with R 4.4.2 "Pile of Leaves")
- **RStudio:** Recommended (tested with RStudio 2025.05.0 Build 496)

### Hardware Requirements
- **RAM:** 16GB (32GB recommended)
- **CPU:** 8 cores (12+ cores recommended)
- **Storage:** ~12GB free disk space for data and results

### Performance Notes
- All analyses are CPU-based; GPU acceleration not required
- Higher specs are primarily for scRNA-seq preprocessing (e.g., doublet removal, Kendall's œÑ computation)
- GAM modeling with [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html) is computationally efficient and does not require high-end specs
- Understanding the algorithm/modeling is key; minimum specs are sufficient for GAM analysis using the processed Seurat object

### Development Environment
- **Developed and tested on:** Intel Core i9-14900KF, 64GB DDR5 RAM, Windows 11 Pro, RStudio 2025.05.0 Build 496, R 4.4.2

## üîÄWorkflow of the Project
![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kahkengwong/GAM_PCa_Project/main/Project_Workflow.jpg)

Key methdologies of this study include **decomposition of model's DE into cell-level**: If a cell highly influences the shape of the fitted spline, then it should have high **explanatory power (EP)**. These cells are termed as **top-ranked EP (TREP) cells**. The decomposition steps are detailed in part (V) of the figure above. 

Another key method is to binarize the transcriptional space by **inflection point (IP)** into **pre-IP and post-IP regions**. These regions exhibit distinct distribution pattern of TREP cells, producing **quadrants of four subpopulation of cells with different biology** - These are detailed in the next section.

**Hence, the CEP-IP framework based on pairwise genes produces quadrants of cell subpopulations, enabling distinct biology identification that may guide therapy.**
